Encapsulation is a mainly used method in programming using object-oriented programming.
It realised with hiding main variables into private state and useing public methods like
getters and setters to get them seen by user. By doing so it helps to protect the internal
state of a variable or an object from unintended or harmful changes that can bbrake a program.

Like here in the class Fraction we can see that principle applied using GetfractionString() and
GetDecimalValue() methods to access private fields of public class Fractions

public class Fractions
{
    private int _numerator;
    private int _denominator;
    public string GetfractionString()
    {
        string frac_string = $"{_numerator}/{_denominator}";
        return frac_string;
    }
    public double GetDecimalValue()
    {
        return (double)_numerator / _denominator;
    }
}

This helps also to maintain the program as you need to make less changes to a program if you need
to change something in its functionality. 

The appliances for encapsulations are seen in many aspects of our life, like banking(data like 
account balance cannot be modified outside the class) or it can be insurance company storing 
users private information which should be accessed in programm only using special methods and
logic to provide the needed level of safety for users information.

But always be carefull while using those methods like Get and Set because overusing them may 
make your class less robust allowing unintended acces or modification of data practically 
braking the sense of using encapsulation in a program.
