The principle of version control
A benefit of version control
An example of version control

Version control is a system that recieves a directory or file from 
your computer and controls changes of files in the directory or in 
file and after finding any changes it allows user to push those 
changes in the system whith commentary about changes. 

In Git version control system these actions are realized in GUI
(graphical user interface) or through a command prompt by next
commands:
To add file or directory to system use:
   git add myfile
or
   git add diriectory_name

As any changes are done  we need to save those locally using:
   git commit -m "commentary"

When changes saved it needs to save changes in systemby using command:
   git push

But why do you need a version control system?
As program is developed its filesystem is growing fastly and daily
it's files are changing. And what if one change brakes the whole
program but you do not have the previous version of that file. In 
that case version control system helps a lot - if you kept to push
and commit changes - you can go back in changes and use previous
version of file to return program in its working condition.

Also when a lot of people work on the same program that divided on
a few files that changing every day. Thanks to the version control
system changes of every file are documented with commentaries of 
developer showing what is changed and with possibility to go back
in the tree of commits.
