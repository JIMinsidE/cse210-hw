What is abstraction and why is it important? 

1. Explain the meaning of Abstraction.
Abstraction is a concept in programming which requires hiding complexity and exposing only 
essential features of a program. It is achieved by separating code into classes with different 
functions and methods which acomplish a certain task and then used in main function. This helps to
 avoid code-repeating, impoves optimisation and reusability of code by ease of its maintainability.
2. Highlight a benefit of Abstraction.
3. Provide an application of Abstraction.
4. Use a code example of Abstraction from the program you wrote. (You should copy and paste a few lines of code that demonstrate the use of the principle.)
5. Thoroughly explain these concepts. (This likely cannot be done in less than 100 words.)
