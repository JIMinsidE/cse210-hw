Inheritance is a very important principle in object-oriented programming that
allows child or subclass to inherit its parental class properties and behaviours.
This means that a child class can access all the methods and variables of superclass
which are public or protected, allowing it to reuse already written code and build
more specialized program for current task.

The major benefit of using Inheritance lies in code rusability in certain power(
to be exactly it is considered to use inheritance until the 4 child after first 
parental class as it will be hard to unwrap all the branches of inheerited classes
and programm becomes less understandable for other people).

For example, in code down below we can see, how this principle applied in the code

public class Assignment
{
    protected string _studentName;
    protected string _topic;

    public Assignment(string studentName, string topic)
    {
        _studentName = studentName;
        _topic = topic;
    }
    public string GetSummary()
    {
        return $"{_studentName} - {_topic}";
    }
}

We have a parental class Assignment with its attributes and methods which are
being used by child class MathAssignment

public class MathAssignment : Assignment // <= By adding this part to the name of the class
{
    private string _textBookSection;
    private string _problems;

    public MathAssignment(string studentName, string topic, string textBookSection, string problems)
        : base(studentName, topic) // <= and ataching parental variables to the constructor of MathAssignment class
    {
        _textBookSection = textBookSection;
        _problems = problems;   
    }
    public string GetHomeworkList()
    {
        return $"{GetSummary()} - Section: {_textBookSection}, Problems: {_problems}"; // <= And then finally using it
    }

}


In real life this method applies to many parts of our lifes, such as basic having a credit or a debit card
They are cards, they have a number, CVV code, validity date, but they are actiually working in different ways
and such ways are programmed in banking systems by using this method to make a program better.
